How to get Help in Linux

it's been quiet a while since i decided to write a blog post explaining how one can get help in Linux. the motivation was simply watching people comming to IRC channels or even our local Linux Users Group (MashhadLug) with problems which they had no idea how to ask the right question or even where to look for it. Yes, I know. some people are just dumb enough not to Google the problem at the first place but it's just a beginning. there are ways the pro people knows which led them to find the solutions more easily and quick than newbies. while i'm not a pro, i think i have somethings to share :)

* RTFM
* README Files
* Google it
* IRC channels
* Read The Code
* join mailing lists

## RTFM (or Read The Fu@%!ng Manual)

there are times you know what you want but you don't know how or what command will do that for you. that's when the `info` and `man pages` comes to help. info documents introduces a fairly detailed document about lots of things. while man pages describe how a program works, info pages more describe what it does. 

* **appropos**: search the manual page names and descriptions
* **info documents**: read info documents. info documents are more descriptive on what a program will do than how to do it. it's pretty much helpfull when you don't know exactly what a program does.
* **man pages**: read tools manual pages. they are more descriptive on how to work with specific programs. usually describing a program's arguments and what they do.

## README Files

there is a clear reason why they called it `README`. if you are working with a source packages of a program or a script which comes with a **README** file, please actually do read it before start bothering other people. also it is recommended to read simillar files like **INSTALL** or **CHANGELOG** files if you have problems installing the program on your linux box.

## Google it

nowadays `Googling` means search for a content on the internet than actually using the google search engine, but it is more convinient for most people to use google search engine as well.

### the art of google-ing

google provide fairly enough ways and tricks to search better for a content. for example if you are searching for a specific error, you can limit the searches for results that have word **SOLVED** in their title since most forums do that.

	intitle:SOLVED <your_query>
	intitle:SOLVED kernel panic+attemped to kill init

the above query, will tell google to show results that have **SOLVED** in their title and words **kernel panic** plus **attemped to kill init** which is the error we are searching to solve. it is a working trick for searching forums. we will cover alternatives later.
